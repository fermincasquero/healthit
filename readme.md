<h1>Software Engineering and Project Management</h1>

<h2>HealthIT - Project</h2>
<br> <hr> <br>
<h3>1. Problem Description</h3> <br> 
HealthIT is an organisation that operates in healthcare projects management. HealthIT
wants to integrate a powerful but simple medical appointment’s tool in their Information
System. In order to provide the necessary comfort to its collaborators, the organization
demands that such tool is capable of performing simple features:<br><br>
1. Schedule Medical Appointment – This feature must allow helpdesk professionals to set up
appointments by registering the patients’ names, the appointment date and time with an
available doctor according to its medical proficiency;<br><br>
2. Reschedule Medical Appointment – This feature must allow helpdesk professionals to
change the appointments details or even cancel them if the appointments have not yet
occurred. Therefore, a search operation must be included in this feature; <br><br>
3. Add Doctor of Medicine - This feature must allow helpdesk professionals to register
doctors’ details by registering doctors’ names, proficiency (pediatrics, dermatology,
cardiology, radiology or infectology), and social security numbers, check in and check out
hours. Additionally, this feature must allow the management of medical proficiencies;<br><br>
4. Consult Patient - This feature must allow doctors to register consultation details by
registering the patients’ symptoms and the medical diagnoses during a medical
appointment. Additionally, this feature must include a search operation to select the
scheduled appointment;<br><br>
<h5>Restrictions:</h5> all features must guarantee the data’s consistency. For instance, data
duplication is not tolerated, appointments can’t be changed if they already occurred, a doctor can’t
have two or more appointments at the same time, a doctor can’t access another doctor’s
appointments, and a doctor can’t have an appointment outside his check in and check out hours.

<h3>2. Goals</h3> <br><br>
The goal of this assignment is the development of a healthcare information system that
addresses the needs of the organization. Therefore, it is necessary to execute a software
development process (SDP) that considers the analysis, design, test and implementation. The
features to develop must address the requirements and challenges proposed by the organization.
